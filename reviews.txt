Fantastic visuals and soundtrack.
Mind-bending story.
Excellent performances by the cast.
A bit too long, but still great.
Loved the ending twist.
Some scenes were confusing.
Really makes you think.
Great cinematography.
Soundtrack was incredible.
Good plot, but too predictable
Horrible acting
Very lackluster chemistry between cast members
